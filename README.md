![Website Screenshot](/media/cs50.png)

Welcome to my <a href="https://muhd-dev.github.io/cs50-fanpage/index.html">CS50x Homepage Website!</a> This website is a showcase of what I have learned in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) lectures during my CS50x journey. It's a project I created as part of a problem set for Week 8 of the course, and it reflects my growth and development in web development and design.

## Overview

This website is a testament to my progress and skills as a web developer. I've integrated various features of CSS and JavaScript to make the site interactive and engaging for users. The project requirements encouraged me to think creatively and use JavaScript to enhance the user experience. Here's a brief overview of what you can find on this website:

- **HTML & CSS:** The foundation of web development. My site is built using HTML and styled with CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and well-structured layout.

- **JavaScript Interactivity:** I've incorporated JavaScript to add interactivity to the site. You'll find elements like buttons, animations, and dynamic content, all powered by JavaScript. Especially how the text fades-out when you click the play button and it toggles the video to play.

- **Video Integration:** One of the standout features of this site is the video background on the homepage. It showcases my ability to integrate multimedia seamlessly into web projects.

## Features

Here are some of the features you'll discover on this website:

- **Interactive Elements:** I've used JavaScript to make buttons clickable, create animations, and enhance user interactions throughout the site.

- **Video Background:** The homepage features a captivating video background that adds visual appeal and engagement.
  
- **About Me:** Learn more about me, my skills, and my passion for web development.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to learn and grow in web development through CS50x and other courses I'm taking, I plan to enhance and expand this website. Here are some areas I intend to improve:

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the site looks great and functions well on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

- **Additional JavaScript Features:** Adding more dynamic elements, such as interactive forms, real-time data fetching, and more advanced animations.

- **Accessibility:** Making the site accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, through improved HTML semantics and ARIA attributes.

- **Optimization:** Optimizing the site's performance for faster loading times and a smoother user experience.
